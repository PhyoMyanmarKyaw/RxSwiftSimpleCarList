# RxSwift Car List
In <b>2022</b>, as I was new to RxSwift, I built this basic iOS app as a take-home project to explore using RxSwift for displaying a simple list.

## Overview
There are no detailed information screens or functionalities within this app.<br />
This project initially aimed to be a simple car list app using RxSwift with caching functionalities.<br />
However, due to project constraints I replaced the car listing API with the <b>Pokemon API:</b> https://docs.dummyapi.online/endpoints/pokemon/
<br /><br /><br />
